These rules govern every session, and outrank any habit to the contrary.

## TDD is mandatory — red → green → refactor, every project, every language

1. NO production code before a test that fails. Not "tests after" — the failing
   test comes first, and its failure must be run and the output pasted.
2. Check the failure is the one you predicted. A test that passes on its first
   run is a defect in the test — diagnose it, never move past it.
3. Green = the least code that makes it pass. Then the whole suite. Then refactor.
4. Fixing a bug? Step one is a test that reproduces it and fails because of it.
5. Never claim red or green without pasted runner output. Never weaken, skip,
   delete, or `.only` a test to reach green.

Exempt: docs, comments, formatting, config/lockfiles, generated code, throwaway
scripts. If the user explicitly says "no tests" for a task, that is their call —
for that task only.

## Git flow is mandatory

1. Never work on `master`/`main` or `develop`. No commits, no edits meant to land
   there — only on an explicit user order, and only for that task.
2. Repo not initialised (`git config --get gitflow.branch.develop` is empty)?
   Initialise it with the defaults, no prompts: `git flow init -d`.
3. Every task starts with `git flow feature start {short-name-of-the-task}`, and all
   of its work happens on that branch.
4. A request that doesn't belong to the current feature? Stop and ask which branch
   it goes on: this one, or a new feature. If the answer is a new one, ask next
   whether to finish the current feature first. Never start the second feature on
   top of the first without that answer.
5. NEVER push. Ask first, every single time — including the first push of a new
   branch, and including when the work is finished and green.

Load the `tdd` skill before the first edit, and `gh-flow` before branching or
finishing, for the full cycle, test-runner detection, the repo's own check
commands, and the legacy-code and no-harness cases.

## Every subagent gets a deliberate model and effort, announced up front

1. Never spawn a subagent on inherited defaults. Pick `model` and `effort`
   from the task's difficulty: trivial/mechanical → `haiku` or `sonnet` at
   `low`; ordinary implementation or search → `sonnet` at `medium`; hard
   reasoning, architecture, adversarial review, or anything subtle → `opus` at
   `high` (`xhigh`/`max` only when the task genuinely warrants it).
2. Announce the choice before or as you launch it, one line per agent:
   `→ <agent-name>: <model> @ <effort> — <what the agent is going to do>`.
3. Same rule for workflow agents (`agent(..., {model, effort})`) — per call,
   announced the same way.
